			 <p>Nothing brings oohs and ahhs as a cute little puppy.  I have personally had the privilege of raising a few puppies, ranging from large breeds to small breeds and a couple sizes in between. Recently our family brought home a fuzzy little bundle of joy who we named Penny.  Penny was 
			  in a parking lot and described by her mom’s family as a hound-lab mix.  After having lost our sweet Boxer mix a few months earlier, we thought this sounded perfect, as we had previous experience with a lab and a hound – and loved them both dearly.  However, we never imagined the new challenge that awaited us with this little puppy curled up in my arms.  As we walked to our car, I remember the gentleman saying “good luck.”  I thought to myself – piece of cake – been there, done that.  I soon found out how <em>little</em> I knew.</p>  
			 <p>Penny spent the first couple of days cuddled up in her little bed, sleeping most of the time.  I was actually a little concerned, never having experienced such a lethargic puppy.  I was actually wondering if maybe she was sick - but within 2 days, her personality started to emerge.  Her true nature emerged gradually, as she approached everything with great caution.  For instance, she took every room as a grand adventure – carefully tiptoeing into the room only when we encouraged her to with treats and playtime.   She soon felt at home and learned to love to explore and play – just like all puppies.  And she <b>LOVED</b> being outdoors – more than any other dog we ever had – rain or shine – and for a pup who was so scared of most things, thunderstorms didn’t even seem to faze her.  We believe she felt most comfortable outside because she was perhaps born and raised outside before we found her.</p>
			 <p>So along with her adorable unique personality came some challenges we had never encountered before when raising our previous puppies.  The first challenge was an extreme hyperactivity – to the point that she would do what we lovingly called “parkour” off all people sitting on the couch upon coming in from exploring outside.  She had a specific time she would engage in this extreme hyperactivity, somewhere around 6 PM.  You could see her eyes physically dilate, and we knew that the witching hour had started.   The good news is that she was still so adorable that we were able to find ways to curb her hyperactive fits and embrace the uniqueness that was Penny.</p>
			 <p>I thought I’d share our tips for overcoming this puppy challenge with you so that you too can conquer this challenge and learn to love your puppy while encouraging their own unique personality.</p>
			 <p>First, we found a way to engage her during this energetic time.  We would take her out into the yard and play games with her.  We found a couple of toys that I will highlight at the end of this article that helped us use her energy in a productive way.  My husband, my daughter, and myself all took turns playing various games with her – usually for about 1-1/2 to 2 hours each night.</p>
			 <p>Second, with her hyperactivity came a over zealous pestering of our two older dogs.  She relentlessly pestered them - insisting they play with her.  She still does everything in her power to encourage our 10-year-old Plotthound to be her playmate.  He’s a big play baby but still has limited energy with which to play with her.  She also chased my little 13-year-old Chihuahua under chairs, attempting in vain to escape the harassment that was unending.  The above technique that included a consistent variety of play games seemed to curb this tendency also.</p>
			 <p>Another bad habit we encountered was relentless play biting.  We’ll discuss some tips for that challenge tomorrow.  Until then, consider adding the following toys listed below to your new puppy arsenal – especially if you to have a hyperactive puppy.  And stay tuned for the surprise reveal on what breed Penny actually turned out to be – it’s too funny – and too cute!</p>
